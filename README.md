# Personal Portfolio Website – Assignment 1-Aarrav Bala

Overview
 This project is my Personal Portfolio Website, created as part of Assignment 1. It is built using HTML5 and CSS3, without relying on frameworks such as Flexbox. The site is hosted live on GitHub Pages and demonstrates responsiveness, semantic HTML, gradients, a consistent colour scheme, and accessibility compliance. All are following the rubric and meeting expectations.

Site Structure
 The portfolio consists of four HTML pages:
Home Page (index.html)

   Contains navigation to all other pages.


  Header, introduction, and footer included.


About Me (about.html)


  Includes my photo and a short introduction.


  Embedded introductory video with poster image and playback controls.


Projects (projects.html)


  Highlights 5 projects with headings and short descriptions.


Contact Me (contact.html)


  Contact form with input fields: Name, Email, Phone, and Comments.


  Includes validation for email and phone number.


Every page includes a footer with my email and copyright.
   Semantic tags such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <article> are consistently used.
Responsiveness and Viewports
   The website uses fluid design and media queries for responsiveness. Separate CSS files were created for different viewport sizes:
    Mobile (up to 600px): simplified layout, stacked navigation, and resized images.


  Tablet (601px – 1024px): balanced layout, navigation optimized for mid-size screens.


  Laptop/Desktop (1025px and above): full layout with larger spacing and font sizes.


Gradients
  A linear gradient was applied to the navigation bar background.


  An angled linear gradient was applied in the footer.


Color Scheme
 The color scheme was generated using Adobe Color. It is based on a complementary palette for contrast and readability.
Primary: Deep Blue (#1A237E)


  Secondary: Light Blue (#64B5F6)


  Accent: Soft Pink (#F48FB1)


  Neutral Backgrounds: White (#FFFFFF), Light Gray (#F5F5F5)


Testing and Validation
  HTML Validation: Passed W3C Markup Validator with no major errors.


  CSS Validation: Passed W3C CSS Validator successfully.


  Link Checker: All navigation and external links checked with W3C Link Checker.


  Spelling: Verified across all pages using browser-based spell check.


  Accessibility: Tested with WAVE Accessibility Tool – no critical errors found.


Version Control and Deployment
  The repository is public and structured with separate folders for HTML, CSS, and media assets.


  Frequent commits were made to document project progress.


  The site is deployed via GitHub Pages at the provided link.


External Code and Tools Used
  W3Schools – examples for HTML form validation (adapted and commented in contact.html).


  MDN Web Docs – gradient syntax reference for CSS.


  GitHub Copilot – used for minor error fixes:
 •   index.html — fixed issues with nav and main wrapper
 •   about.html — corrected closed </video> tag
 •   projects.html — corrected closing </html> tag and added rel attributes to external links
Also used to help improve flow of code to make sure its not messy and its easier to read
-Chat GPT was used to check if all requirements from the rubric were met, a simple scan through no code manipulation 
All other code was written by me, and external code was only used minimally, and AI was only used to improve flow and fix mistakes, but the main code was not generated. Comments are included in the code to explain functionality.
