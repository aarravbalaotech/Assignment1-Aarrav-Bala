            Board of Governors Nomination Committee Assignment
          </a>
        </h3>
      <p>
This project involved participating in a class discussion about nominees for the Ontario Tech University Board of Governors. Each student analyzed the candidates by outlining their strengths and weaknesses, then selected two nominees for deeper research. I evaluated their qualifications, gathered supporting evidence, and presented a written justification explaining why they were suitable candidates for the position. I then wrote it all in this report format.

        </h3>
        <p>
            his project was developed using ARMv7 Assembly Language to create a simple arithmetic calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. It includes error handling for invalid cases such as division by zero. The program was designed with a modular structure, making it easy to expand with new features or improvements in the future.
